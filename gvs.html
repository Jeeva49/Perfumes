<p>Perfume, also known as parfum, is a mixture of fragrant essential oils or aroma compounds, fixatives, and solvents used to give pleasant scents to the human body, animals, food, objects, and living spaces12345. Perfumes can be made from natural aromatics or synthetic chemicals12. They emit and diffuse a fragrant odor5. Perfumery has been around since ancient civilizations1. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds1.</p>
